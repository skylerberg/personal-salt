Meta states
===========

Meta state are collections of other states. The purpose of this folder is to
make it easier to quickly configure a system appropriately. A top file provides
has no way of knowing if a computer is a work computer, or a personal computer.
Furthermore, a top file has no way of knowing how much time I want to wait for
my configuration in the moment.

For example, if I have a fresh VM which I want to work on, I can choose 
appropriate meta state. I will omit meta states that require a large time 
investment (think LaTeX) since I will dispose of the environment in fairly 
short order anyhow.

Note: Meta states are not a thing you should know about. This name is just a 
convention used in this project.
